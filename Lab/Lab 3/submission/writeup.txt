Section 5: Salted vs non salted hashcracking: 
With the inclusiion of an extra salting charachter, the size of the rainbow table increased dramatically (from 9.6 MB to 32 MB) . Apart from the size increase, the generation timing for the rtable was increased since there are now more charachters to take into account. 

With this in mind, we can see that just for lowercase charachters and alpha numeric from 5 - 6 charachters was almost quadrupling in size, and for 1-9 characters with mixed alpha-numeric keysize, the size was 864GB.

With a change from 3800 chain length to 8000, and from 600000 chain size to 2 million, initially i could crack all the hashes but with salting, i could only crack 14 out of the 15 hashes.

Section 6:
Fot the hash cracking competition, i tried to use hashcrack with bruteforce and rule based cracking, but this was inefficient since this was taking 48 hours of run time. In order to bypass that, I tried running the findmyhash tool (available at https://github.com/Talanor/findmyhash), and with that i was able to crack 70 out of the 200 passwords. 

Looking at alternatives available online, I found 4 websites: crackstation (https://crackstation.net), hashkiller (https://hashkiller.co.uk/md5-decrypter.aspx), md5decrypter(http://www.md5decrypter.com) and md5online(http://www.md5online.org), and using these i was able to decrypt 132 out of the 200 hashes.


Cracked hashes are present in hashes.txt
